SVD and Alternating Least Square model; Rating Matrix was very sparse with sparsity of 99.4%
- Developed advanced models like Stochastic Gradient Descent - based model, Neural Network based model, Random Forest Regressor
based model and an ensemble model to achieve higher performance on the sparse rating matrix completion task
